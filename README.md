ZDC_PID_Motor_ControllerV1.0
============================

The ZENG-DXL is an embedded driver module for small robots and educational propose which designed and developed at the AUT Robotic Research Center (ARC). The aim of this project is to develop a cheap, simple and powerfull interface and comunication based module for DC motor drive based on TTL hulf duplex serial communication with internal PID controller. It can provide high speed I/O and more useful function for PID controll of speed and Position using Internal shaft encoder or multi turn potentiometer. The ZENG-DXL can be controlled via a serial interface and therefore which are simple and compact enough to be further processed by a low power CPU like a microcontroller using ROBOTIS.Co Dynamixel 3Pin communication protocol. 

Specification:
  * Controller: PID controller on speed and position.
  * Processor: AVR ATMega8 micro controller working @16MHz.
  * Speed Controller Sensors: Internal 32000 palse per round shaft encoder.
  * Position Controller Sensor: Absolute multi turn potentiometer, ADC 10 bit.
  * Loop Speed: PID controller loop runs under 500Hz.
  * Comunication: Serial hulf duplex ttl comunication based on ROBOTIS.LTD,.
